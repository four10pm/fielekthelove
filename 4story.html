            <p class="storyBio">
                In September 2014, Pawe&#322; and Paulina were both invited to a housewarming party.
                Neither of them were friends directly with the housemates, and both of them considered not going to the
                party but end up deciding to go.
            </p>
            <p class="storyBio">
                Paulina was waiting in the foyer when Pawe&#322; walked in with his friends. They both noticed each
                other.
                When they ended up in the same apartment, they spent most of the night chatting, joking about Poland and
                Russia.
            </p>
            <p class="storyBio">
                They went on their first date a week later.
            </p>
            <p class="storyBio">
                In 2015, Pawe&#322; was accepted to the General Assembly coding bootcamp and moved in with Paulina in
                Alphabet City.
                In May 2015, Paulina graduated NYU and Pawe&#322; graduated GA.
            </p>
            <p class="storyBio">
                Pawe&#322; and Paulina moved in together (officially) in Kensington, Brooklyn in September 2015.
                They lived there for a year and a half before moving to Williamsburg, Brooklyn, in February 2017.
            </p>
            <p class="storyBio">
                Shortly after their 7th anniversary, Pawe&#322; and Paulina went on vacation to Acadia National Park,
                Maine.
                After a challenging hike up Cadillac Mountain for a sunset view, Pawe&#322; proposed to Paulina in the
                dense fog.
                They tried to hike down a different trail, but it got dark and they started getting lost, so they walked
                down
                the main road instead.
                Exhausted and excited, they returned to their AirBnB to share their news.
            </p>
            <p class="storyBio">
                In September 2022, they will get married at Bear Mountain Inn, surrounded by their closest friends and
                family, followed by a honeymoon to Peru.
                They're very excited to start the next phase of their lives together!
